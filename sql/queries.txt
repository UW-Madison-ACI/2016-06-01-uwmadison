SELECT * FROM surveys

SELECT year FROM surveys

SELECT year, month, day FROM surveys

SELECT year, year, year FROM surveys

select year from surveys

SELECT DISTINCT year FROM surveys

SELECT DISTINCT year, month FROM surveys

SELECT DISTINCT year, month, day FROM surveys

SELECT year, month, day, weight FROM surveys

SELECT year, month, day, weight/1000.0 FROM surveys

SELECT year, month, day, ROUND(weight/1000.0, 3) FROM surveys

SELECT year, species_id, sex, hindfoot_length, weight*1000 FROM surveys

SELECT * FROM surveys
WHERE (year > 2000)

SELECT * FROM surveys
WHERE (year >= 2000) AND (species_id = 'DM')

SELECT * FROM surveys
WHERE (species_id = 'DM') OR (species_id = 'DO') OR (species_id = 'DS')

SELECT * FROM surveys
WHERE species_id IN ('DM', 'DO', 'DS')

SELECT species_id, sex, hindfoot_length, weight*1000 FROM surveys
WHERE (year >= 2000) AND (species_id IN ('DM', 'DO', 'DS'))

SELECT species_id, sex, hindfoot_length, weight*1000 FROM surveys
WHERE (year >= 2000) AND (species_id IN ('DM', 'DO', 'DS')) 
ORDER BY weight DESC

SELECT species_id, sex, hindfoot_length, weight*1000 FROM surveys
WHERE (year >= 2000) AND (species_id IN ('DM', 'DO', 'DS')) 
ORDER BY weight DESC, hindfoot_length ASC

SELECT * FROM surveys
WHERE (year >= 2000) AND (species_id IN ('DM', 'DO', 'DS')) 
ORDER BY year, month, day

## Aggregation
-----------

SELECT weight*1000 FROM surveys

SELECT AVG(weight) from surveys

SELECT SUM(weight) from surveys

SELECT ROUND(SUM(weight)/1000.0, 3) from surveys

SELECT AVG(weight), SUM(weight), MIN(weight), MAX(weight) from SURVEYS

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM surveys

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM surveys GROUP BY species_id

SELECT species_id, COUNT(*) FROM surveys GROUP BY species_id

SELECT species_id, COUNT(*), AVG(weight) FROM surveys GROUP BY year, species_id

SELECT species_id, COUNT(*), AVG(weight) FROM surveys GROUP BY year, species_id
HAVING AVG(weight) > 0

-----------

SELECT year, plot_id, species_id, COUNT(*), AVG(weight) FROM surveys 
WHERE (plot_id <= 4) AND (species_id IN ('DS', 'DM', 'DO')) 
GROUP BY year, plot_id, species_id ORDER BY year, plot_id

------------
## Joins
------------

SELECT * FROM surveys JOIN species ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id;

SELECT surveys.year, surveys.month, surveys.day, species.genus, species.species
FROM surveys JOIN species ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id;

SELECT species.genus, species.species, surveys.weight
FROM surveys JOIN species ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id WHERE species.taxa = 'Rodent'

SELECT species.genus, species.species, AVG(surveys.weight)
FROM surveys JOIN species ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id WHERE species.taxa = 'Rodent'
GROUP BY species.species_id

SELECT surveys.year, surveys.month, surveys.day, species.genus, species.species, COUNT(*)
FROM surveys JOIN species ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id GROUP BY year, month, day, surveys.species_id

## Final Exercises
---------

1. SELECT plot_type, count(*) AS num_plots  FROM plots  GROUP BY plot_type  ORDER BY num_plots DESC
2. SELECT year, sex, count(*) AS num_animal  FROM surveys  WHERE sex IS NOT null  GROUP BY sex, year
3. SELECT species_id, plot_type, count(*) FROM surveys JOIN plots ON surveys.plot_id=plots.plot_id WHERE species_id IS NOT null GROUP BY species_id, plot_type
4. SELECT taxa, AVG(weight) FROM surveys JOIN species ON species.species_id=surveys.species_id GROUP BY taxa
5. SELECT taxa, 100.0*count(*)/(SELECT count(*) FROM surveys) FROM surveys JOIN species ON surveys.species_id=species.species_id GROUP BY taxa
6. SELECT surveys.species_id, MIN(weight) as min_weight, MAX(weight) as max_weight, AVG(weight) as mean_weight FROM surveys JOIN species ON surveys.species_id=species.species_id WHERE taxa = 'Rodent' GROUP BY surveys.species_id
7. SELECT surveys.species_id, sex, AVG(hindfoot_length) as mean_foot_length  FROM surveys JOIN species ON surveys.species_id=species.species_id WHERE taxa = 'Rodent' AND sex IS NOT NULL GROUP BY surveys.species_id, sex
8. SELECT surveys.species_id, year, AVG(weight) as mean_weight FROM surveys JOIN species ON surveys.species_id=species.species_id WHERE taxa = 'Rodent' GROUP BY surveys.species_id, year
